# 100 Days of DevOps 🚀

This repository documents my **100 Days of DevOps challenge**, where I revisit core DevOps and Cloud concepts through **hands-on, real-world tasks**.

Even with industry experience, consistent practice is essential to:
- Retain concepts long-term
- Strengthen fundamentals
- Build confidence in real production scenarios

Each day includes:
- Task description
- Why the task is important
- Real-world relevance
- Commands and explanations
- Clear conclusions for future revision

📌 Inspired by real-world challenges from platforms like KodeKloud.
